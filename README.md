# API Test Automation using Axios

## What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP Client for node.js and the browser. 
It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and nodejs with the same codebase). 
On the server-side it uses the native node.js HTTP module, while on the client (browser) it uses XMLHttpRequests.

## Installation

```shell
npm install axios
```

## Usage

### Test runing

```shell
npm run test
```

### Test run and report generating

npm run report
```

### Report folder remove
